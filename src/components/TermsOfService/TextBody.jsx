      <h2>1. Acceptance of the Terms of Use</h2>
      <p>Claims Crafters, LLC (“Claim Crafters”, “we” or “us”) operates this website, including any subdomains, mobile applications, or other extensions (collectively, the “Website”). The Website is offered and available only to users who are 18 years of age or older and who reside in the United States or any of its territories or possessions. By using or accessing the Website, (1) you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and meet the foregoing eligibility requirements and (2) you agree to these Terms of Use (the “Terms”). If you do not meet all of the foregoing requirements or if you do not agree to the Terms, then you must not access or use the Website and you are not authorized to do so.</p>
      <p>Please read the Terms carefully before using the Website. We may change the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion by posting revised terms to the Website. Any change to the Terms will be effective immediately upon posting to the Website and will apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. Your use of the Website following the posting of revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. You are expected to review the Terms from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes, as the Terms are binding on you whether or not you have read them.</p>

      <h2>2. About the Website and Claims Crafters’ Role</h2>
      <p>Our company and our online application, ContentsIQ, specializes in providing residential content valuations within the insurance industry. We offer detailed assessments of household contents for insurance purposes, helping to accurately value items in case of insurance claims. It is important for our users to understand that we do not provide insurance services, nor do we review insurance claims beyond the scope of content valuation. Our expertise is strictly limited to the assessment and valuation of residential contents for insurance purposes.</p>
      <p>Our website offers users content, functionality, and services related specifically to insurance contents valuations. While we may provide tools or information that could be used in the context of insurance claims, we do not offer claims-related advice, process insurance claims, remedy claims, or negotiate claims on behalf of homeowners, insurance carriers, or their partners and representatives.</p>
      <p>Users of our website should be aware that while we may facilitate information exchange related to contents valuation, we are not a party to any insurance claims or agreements between users and their insurance carriers or any third party. Our role is exclusively that of a valuation service provider. Furthermore, we are not an insurer, insurance agent, or legal advisor. While we may provide general information about the valuation process and its relevance to insurance claims, any legal or insurance-related decisions should be made in consultation with qualified professionals in those respective fields. Users are encouraged to seek legal or insurance advice before making decisions based on the valuations provided by our services.</p>

FURTHERMORE, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE WEBSITE OR THE TERMS MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES OR SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.
 THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

{/* 20. Indemnification */}
<h2>20. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) brought by, made against, or suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party and arising out of or relating to your violation of the Terms or your use of the Website, including, but not limited to, any User Content you provide, your use of or reliance on the Website or any features, functionality or content thereof.
  </p>

  {/* 21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction */}
  <h2>21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>
    The Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Subject to Florida Statute Florida Statute §47.011, any legal proceedings against us that may arise out of, relate to, or be in any way connected with the Website or the Terms shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the City and County of St. Petersburg (Pinellas County), Florida , and you waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.
  </p>

  {/* 22. Dispute Resolution */}
  <h2>22. Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>
    We and you each agree to make an initial attempt to resolve any disputes by contacting each other and providing a written description of the issue, along with all relevant documents/information, and the proposed resolution. You can reach us with disputes by emailing us at support@claimscrafters.com, and we will attempt to contact you based on the contact information you have provided.
  </p>
  <p>
    If after 30 days, we are unable to resolve a dispute, then the dispute may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with this section. You acknowledge that, without this provision, you would have had the right or opportunity to litigate the dispute in a court and have it decided by a judge or jury.
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, any dispute between you and any Indemnified Party (including, as permitted by applicable law, third parties who are not signatories to this agreement) that is not resolved through negotiation, including disputes over the validity or applicability of this arbitration clause, shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by JAMS under its rules and procedures as they exist when the claim is filed. All arbitration claims should be filed with the Florida JAMS Office. You can find rules, procedures, and fee information on JAMS’ website (<a href="www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>) or by contacting the Florida office of JAMS.
  </p>
  <p>
    This arbitration agreement is part of a transaction involving interstate commerce, and therefore it and any proceedings under it will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator(s) can be entered as a judgment in any court with jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that: (a) if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue court claims strictly limited to collecting the past due debt and any permissible interest or collection costs; (b) either party may take disputes over the validity of any party’s intellectual property rights to a court of competent jurisdiction; (c) disputes related to or arising from allegations of fraudulent or unauthorized use, theft, or piracy of service may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction; (d) either party may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, necessary to protect rights or property pending the completion of arbitration; and (e) disputes within the jurisdiction of an applicable small claims court may be brought in that court instead of arbitration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, we agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and the Indemnified Party, not as part of a class claim. If any court or arbitrator finds this restriction to be unconscionable or unenforceable, then the agreement to arbitrate does not apply and the class-wide dispute must be brought in court.

  <h2>25. Miscellaneous</h2>
  <p>
    No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.
  </p>
  <p>
    Except where specifically stated otherwise, if any part of the Terms is unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, you and we both agree that only that part of the Terms shall be stricken and that the remaining provisions in the Terms shall not be affected. So, for example, if a provision in these terms is found to be unenforceable, we agree an arbitrator (or, if permitted, a court) shall only strike that provision and that the remaining provisions of the Terms shall remain in force. The Terms constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may not assign the Terms or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. Any such purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent will be null and void and of no force and effect. We may assign the Terms and any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder without your consent and without notice.
